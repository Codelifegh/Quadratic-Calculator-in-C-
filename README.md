# Quadratic-Calculator-in-Cpp-
A simple calculator in C++
The Quadratic Formula uses the "a", "b", and "c" from "ax²+bx+c=0", where "a", "b", and "c" are just numbers; they are the "numerical coefficients" of the quadratic equation they've given you to solve.

Practice The Quadratic Formula

The Quadratic Formula is derived from the process of completing the square, and is formally stated as:

The Quadratic Formula: For ax2 + bx + c = 0, the values of x which are the solutions of the equation are given by:

x = -b(sqrt{b^2 - 4ac)/(2a) 

This calculates the real solution of the quadratic equation ax²+bx+c=0
Read in the values for the parameters a,b,c(type float).
Then the program should calculate the solution considering the following circumstances:
a=0 and b=0=>Not a valid equation
a=0 and b≠0 => x=-c/b
b² -4ac < 0 => Not a Real Solution
b² -4ac >0 => x1= (-b+√(b² -4ac))/2a , x2= (-b -√(b² -4ac))/2a
